    <h1>Why care about UNIX?</h1>
    <p>
        Unix has played a foundational role in the development of modern computing and continues to be a preferred operating system for many professionals today.
        Its influence can be seen in many contemporary operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and BSD variants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unix systems are firstly known for their stability and uptime, making them a preferred choice for servers, mainframes, and enterprise environments, and is thus very used by system administrators. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Unix is also particularly secure, as it follows a multi-user security model, where permissions and access controls help protect data and processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also widely usable on many different platforms, ever since Unix was rewritten in C in 1973.
        It boasts efficient resource management, built-in networking capabilities, a powerful command-line interface (CLI) with tools like grep, awk, sed, and bash scripting, and lastly, a community! 
    </p>
    <p>
        While traditional Unix was proprietary, Unix-like systems like Linux and BSD are open-source, offering free and customizable alternatives.
        The Unix community is large, active, and supportive. 
        It is for employees, students, and hobbyists alike.
